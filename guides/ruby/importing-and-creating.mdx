If any features & plans were missed as part of this flow, or you want to add any new features and plans programmatically, then you can achieve this through the GraphQL API.

You may also want to import your existing users and their current subscriptions to plans into Kana. If you use Stripe, then we allow you to import your existing users and map their subscriptions through our Stripe Integration. You can set this up via our Dashboard and match Stripe packages to Kana plans during that flow likewise.

If you don't use Stripe, then you can create users through our GraphQL API in order to import them in to Kana, and then programatically create them when they sign up to your product.
