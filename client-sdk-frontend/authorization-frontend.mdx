## Description

Our Client SDK will accept two methods of authorization:

- **Simple Mode**

- **Secure Mode**

While Simple Mode requires no backend and is therefore super easy to setup, Secure Mode will ensure that only a given user's data can ever be loaded. Our Client SDK is read-only and no sensitive data is ever returned, but if you'd like that extra layer of security, this is the best method of authorization.

<Note>
There's no toggle to enforce Secure Mode is used currently. You can easily use one method or the other depending on your use-case. If you ever need us to rotate your Public API Key, just let us know and we'll be happy to do so.
