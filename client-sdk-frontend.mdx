Our Javascript SDK allows you to **integrate Kana client-side** with your product. It offers you the ability to understand a user's access to your features and their current subscriptions to plans - perfect for paywalling, subscription and billing-based use-cases.

## Authentication

You'll need to fetch a `userToken` and provide this when initializing the Kana JS Client instance in order for calls to be successfully made. We have a handy guide which goes into further detail on how to obtain and provide this.
